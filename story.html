            <h1>Story</h1><br>
            <p>The story begins with a valiant knight who sets forth on a harrowing quest, driven by the haunting memory
                of his beloved sister, cruelly slain by monstrous fiends. With a heart forged in sorrow and a blade
                sharpened by vengeance, he traverses through shadowy forests, perilous dungeons, and ancient, forgotten
                ruins. Each encounter with the fearsome creatures tests his resolve, yet strengthens his spirit. As he
                battles through the darkness, every victory is a step closer to the final reckoning with the monstrous
                overlord who shattered his world. Guided by love and justice, the knight's journey is a poignant dance
                of fury and redemption, where he will not rest until the monsters pay dearly for their sins.</p>
